# Course File Generator

Instructors are required to generate a comprehensive final report for each course upon completion, which includes information such as student marks, attendance records, grade summary, academic calendar, and timetables. However, creating this report can be an arduous task, especially if the instructor is responsible for multiple courses.

To streamline this process and save valuable time and energy, we have developed the Course File PDF Generator. This user-friendly tool is specifically designed to assist instructors in generating a merged file that includes a pre-defined set of information related to the course outcomes and templates. 

With this tool, instructors need only upload the necessary files, and a polished, professional-quality PDF will be automatically generated. The Course Outcome PDF Generator allows instructors to create a comprehensive report for each course with minimal effort, helping to improve efficiency and enhance the quality of course administration.
